# Oracle Bone Inscriptions Multi-modal Dataset (OBIMD)

## Dataset Overview

The Oracle Bone Inscriptions Multi-modal Dataset (OBIMD) is the first large-scale corpus providing pixel-aligned rubbings and facsimiles, character-level annotations, and sentence-level transcriptions and reading sequences for oracle bone inscription (OBI) research. This dataset enables multi-modal learning across visual, structural, and linguistic dimensions, laying the foundation for end-to-end OBI recognition and interpretation.

## Dataset Statistics

- Total OBI images: 10,077 across five Shang Dynasty phases
- Annotated characters: 93,652
- Missing character positions: 21,667 (due to fragmentation)
- Sentences: 21,941 syntactically validated
- Non-sentential elements: 4,192

## Data Structure

The dataset follows a three-level hierarchy:

1. Image-level: Contains rubbing and facsimile pairs
2. Sentence-level: Groups characters into meaningful units
3. Character-level: Detailed annotations for each character

## Data Modalities

1. Rubbing images: Original scanned images of oracle bones
2. Facsimile images: Expert reconstructions aligned with rubbings
3. Character annotations: Bounding boxes and classifications
4. Sentence groupings: Semantic organization of characters
5. Reading sequences: Order of characters within sentences

## Usage Notes

The dataset is designed to support various research tasks:

- Character detection and recognition
- Sentence-level character clustering
- Character reordering within sentences
- Multi-modal analysis (rubbing vs. facsimile)

## Technical Validation

### character-level detection
