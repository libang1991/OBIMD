# Oracle Bone Inscriptions Multi-modal Dataset (OBIMD)

## Dataset Overview

The Oracle Bone Inscriptions Multi-modal Dataset (OBIMD) is the first large-scale corpus providing pixel-aligned rubbings and facsimiles, character-level annotations, and sentence-level transcriptions and reading sequences for oracle bone inscription (OBI) research. This dataset enables multi-modal learning across visual, structural, and linguistic dimensions, laying the foundation for end-to-end OBI recognition and interpretation.

This dataset is also available on Hugging Face Hub:<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/KLOBIP/OBIMD">ðŸ¤—OBIMD Dataset</a>

## Dataset Statistics

- Total OBI images: 10,077 across five Shang Dynasty phases
- Annotated characters: 93,652
- Missing character positions: 21,667 (due to fragmentation)
- Sentences: 21,941 syntactically validated
- Non-sentential elements: 4,192

## Data Structure

The dataset follows a three-level hierarchy:

1. Image-level: Contains rubbing and facsimile pairs
2. Sentence-level: Groups characters into meaningful units
3. Character-level: Detailed annotations for each character

## Usage Notes

The dataset is designed to support various research tasks:

- Character detection and recognition
- Sentence-level character clustering
- Character reordering within sentences
- Multi-modal analysis (rubbing vs. facsimile)

## Technical Validation

### character-level detection
We benchmark oracle bone character detection and recognition using a four-way setting across image types (rubbing vs. facsimile) and character types (main vs. sub-character). Models are trained with YOLOv11l and evaluated on mAP, precision, recall, and F1 metrics. Results confirm the datasetâ€™s effectiveness while also revealing difficulties in detecting blurred strokes and handling highly varied character shapes.
### sentence-level clustering
This task groups characters into sentence-level clusters based on category and layout. We evaluate using standard clustering metrics such as AMI, NMI, ARI, and Purity. The results demonstrate promising intra-cluster consistency, while inter-sentence confusion suggests room for improvement in complex layouts.
### character-level reordering
We assess sequential modeling of oracle bone inscriptions by recovering original reading order in shuffled sentences. A Transformer-based model predicts positional indices, achieving over 75% top-1 accuracy on main characters. These results show the feasibility of structure-aware ordering despite script irregularities.
